# Claude AI Assistant Configuration

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS READ FIRST

**Before ANY action, you MUST:**
1. Read and follow `@.agent/rules/ai-rules.md` in this workspace
2. Check current Git status before making changes
3. Commit changes following Conventional Commits format

## Primary Reference Document

```
@.agent/rules/ai-rules.md - MANDATORY reading for:
- Collaboration protocols
- Git strategy
- Personas (PM, Architect, QA, etc.)
- Code conventions
- Quality gates
- Debugging rules
```

## 🚨 Core AI Rules (MUST KNOW)

**Even if you don't read the full ai-rules.md, you MUST follow these:**

### The 5 Immutable Laws

1. **Deep Verification**: After data operations, don't just trust logs - **query the DB directly** to cross-verify
2. **Single Socket**: KIS API maintains only one socket connection (no dual socket attempts)
3. **Doomsday Check**: If 0 data for 60 seconds, immediately initiate recovery procedures
4. **Auto-Proceed**: Safe operations that pass unit tests should execute immediately
5. **Reporting**: All changes must be synchronized to 3 core docs (`README`, `Roadmap`, `Registry`)

### Language Principles

- **Artifacts**: All outputs (Task, Plan, Walkthrough) MUST be in **Korean**
- **Commits**: Commit messages MUST be in **English** (Conventional Commits format)

**Detailed rules**: `.agent/rules/ai-rules.md`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### Git Workflow (from .agent/rules/ai-rules.md)
- **NEVER** make code changes without committing
- **ALWAYS** use Conventional Commits format
- **ALWAYS** check `git status` before starting work
- Use feature branches for non-trivial changes

### Quality Gates (from .agent/rules/ai-rules.md)
- Tier 1: Unit tests + coverage
- Tier 2: Schema validation
- Tier 3: E2E + performance

### Personas (from .agent/rules/ai-rules.md)
- 👔 PM: Strategy, roadmap
- 🏛️ Architect: Design, tech decisions
- 🧪 QA: Testing, validation
- 🔧 Infra: Infrastructure, deployment
- 👨‍💻 Developer: Implementation
- 📝 Doc Specialist: Documentation

## If You Violate These Rules

**STOP immediately and:**
1. Acknowledge the violation
2. Correct the mistake
3. Document what went wrong
4. Prevent future occurrences

## This File's Purpose

This `.claude.md` exists because `.agent/rules/ai-rules.md` alone gets **ignored across sessions**.
This file serves as a **mandatory checkpoint** that Claude must read first.

**Remember: `.agent/rules/ai-rules.md` is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. This file just points to it.**
